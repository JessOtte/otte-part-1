[Otte]-Part-1

I had a really hard time determining whether I wanted to use a button or a stylized link. (I read that good practice is to use a stylized link if it is NOT a meaningful href/not associated with a forum) However, I ended up using a button to follow more closely with the style guide. Furthermore, when I followed the style guide for styling my buttons, it didn't look the same as the design reference, so instead I got my website to look as close to the design reference as possible - I hope that was the right call. Lastly, on mobile, I was really struggling figuring out how to make my top nav button go full width. I unfortunately was unable to figure it out.

I also think my fonts don't look as bold as the reference, but I couldn't figure out what was going wrong. Hopefully it's just the way I was viewing the reference image, and points are not docked for that.
